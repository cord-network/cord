//! # Registries Pallet - Part of `DeDir (Decentralized Directory)`.
//!
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The Registries pallet which is part of the `DeDir (Decentralized Directory)` aims to implement a
//! decentralized version of a Registry. Enabling creation, updation of registries, delegation
//! management in a decentralized manner. Thereby enabling trust and transperency of Registries
//! utilizing CORD blockchain.
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! ### Dispatchable Functions
//!
//! * `create` - Create a new Registry.
//! * `update` - Update the existing Registry.
//! * `update_state` - Change the state of the Registry.
//! * `add_owner_delegate` - Add a account as part of delegates with `OWNER` permission.
//! * `add_admin_delegate` - Add a account as part of delegates with `ADMIN` permission.
//! * `add_delegate` - Add a account as part of delegates with `DELEGATE` permission.
//! * `remove_admin_delegate` - Remove `ADMIN` permission for a account.
//! * `remove_delegate` - Remove `DELEGATE` permission for a account.
