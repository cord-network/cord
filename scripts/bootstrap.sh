# Warning: Protect Your Account Information
# Your account information, especially the secret key, is crucial for the security of the CORD network.
# Please follow these essential security guidelines to keep your account safe and secure:

# 1. Secret Key URI: The Secret Key URI is like the master key to your account. Never share it with anyone or store it in an easily accessible location.
# 2. Secret Seed: The secret seed is the foundation of your account's security. Store it in a secure and offline location.
# 3. Public Key: While the public key (hex) and Account ID are not secret, they are associated with your account.
# 4. Public Key (SS58): This is your account's address in SS58 format. It can be safely shared for receiving funds.
# 5. SS58 Address: Your SS58 address is used for transactions and receiving funds. It is safe to share publicly.

# Remember that anyone with access to your secret key can control your account and its assets. Keep it confidential and store it securely.
# If you suspect your account's security has been compromised, take immediate action to secure it, such as transferring your assets to a new account with a new secret key.
# By following these security practices, you can help ensure the safety and integrity of your account and nodes.
