// the default numeric type).
//
// We can't use `cfg(test)` here, because that configuration directive does not
// propagate between crates, which would fail to fix tests in crates other than
// this one.
//
// Instead, let's take advantage of the observation that what really matters for a
// ParaId within a test context is that it is unique and constant. I believe that
// there is no case where someone does `(-1).into()` anyway, but if they do, it
// never matters whether the actual contained ID is `-1` or `4294967295`. Nobody
// does arithmetic on a `ParaId`; doing so would be a bug.
